## Introduction

Urban land classification is crucial for urban planning, sustainability analysis, and geospatial monitoring. This project aims to classify satellite image tiles by typology (residential, industrial, etc.) and detect amenities (parks, schools, etc.) using a custom-trained deep CNN. The task involves geospatial data extraction, automated labeling via spatial intersection, and supervised CNN training.

## Data Sources

- **Satellite Imagery**: Sentinel-2 Level-2A RGB data accessed via Google Earth Engine (Juneâ€“August 2023).
- **Labels**: Automatically generated using OpenStreetMap data for `landuse`, `amenity`, `leisure`, `tourism`, and `natural` tags, using the `osmnx` and `geopandas` Python libraries.

Each 512x512m tile was extracted as a GeoTIFF image and intersected with OSM features to generate single typology labels and multi-label amenity presence.

## Specification

- **Tile Extraction**: ~4200 tiles for the Chicago metro area, at 10m resolution.
- **Labeling**: Spatial intersection used to assign each tile one dominant land use and four binary amenity labels.
- **Model**: A custom CNN with shared convolutional layers and two output heads:
  - Softmax for typology classification
  - Sigmoid for multi-label amenity detection

## Programming

The code is written in Python using:
- `earthengine-api` for image access
- `rasterio` for GeoTIFF handling
- `torch` and `torchvision` for model development
- `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for evaluation and visualization

All processes, including dataset generation, preprocessing, CNN setup, training and evaluation is within this [jupyter notebook](dataset_generation_and_CNN.ipynb)

## Results

- **Typology accuracy**: ~56% on validation set
- **Amenity ROC AUC**:
  - Water: 0.89
  - Park: 0.77
  - School: 0.71
  - Museum: 0.69

Confusion matrix shows strong performance for common classes like residential and industrial, with lower recall on rare typologies.

The model performs best on well-represented classes and easily detectable features. Label imbalance and semantic ambiguity in OSM data present challenges, which are discussed in the thesis.
